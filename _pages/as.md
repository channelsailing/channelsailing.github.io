This page is part of a feasibility study for a more streamlined CSSA Skipper Approval Process.

The first step is for an aspiring CSSA Skipper to register their contact details with the CSSA offshore Committee.  These details are required to enable the Offshore Secretary to manage the CSSAs  Register of Approved Skippers and the CSSA Approved Skipper Application process.

Anyone registering their details here will receive an email explaining how to proceed with their application.  If no email is received within an hour of submission, please email the <a href="mailto:offshore_sec@cs-sailing.org.uk">CSSA Offshore Sec</a> to investigate.
