To become an Approved Skipper a member must possess a RYA/MCA Certificate of Competence as a Yachtmaster Coastal, Yachtmaster Offshore or Yachtmaster Ocean. The applicant's First Aid Certificate must also be in-date and RYA approved.  In addition, applicants will need to submit the contact details for two CSSA Approved Skippers at equivalent or higher standard than that applied for with whom they have sailed and who have agreed to act as referees.

Experienced skippers who only need references in order to become an Approved Skipper should inquire about the CSD Fast Track Process.
