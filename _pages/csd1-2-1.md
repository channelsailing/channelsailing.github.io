Once introduced to sailing with CSD, members have said it is hard to find a way round the different sailing options and making the necessary contacts. Once hooked on sailing we all want to make the most of the challenges and fun that sailing offers. Progressing to our next level, whatever this is, can be made easier with a little help from a friend; whether it’s guidance on training, qualifications, regulations, confidence building, how CSD operates or simply getting afloat more often. The CSD1-2-1 scheme is designed to help.

CSD1-2-1 therefore seeks to pair-up Club members who would like advice, guidance and practical help with developing their sailing experience, with a CSSA Approved Skipper who would like to share the benefit of their established skills, knowledge and experience.

This is a flexible, informal arrangement between two shipmates centred on a maturing relationship over an agreed timeframe. Once teamed-up, each pair will talk through and agree what works for them in terms of the mix of needs, sailing opportunities, when, where and how often they might meet, and how they will stay in contact in between times. The pairing will be open-ended but with a review point after 12 months with an expectation that the arrangement will not need to exceed a couple of years.

The CSD Committee is responsible for CSD1-2-1 and has asked The Yacht Secretary, Charter Organiser and Crew Bureau Secretary to oversee the scheme on its behalf. The Committee has also appointed Colin Hurd as the volunteer CSD1-2-1 Coordinator.
