Day Sails / Taster Sails  (and Group Day Sails) are a fun day out from 09.00 hours to 18.00 hours.  These events are principally organised as an introduction to sailing a yacht.

 	<li>The day commences with a safety brief.  Then we motor down the Hamble River to Southampton Water, raise the sails and then proceed into the sheltered waters of the Solent under sail.</li>
 	<li>We often stop for lunch at anchor or in a nearby harbour before  raising sail again for the return passage to Mercury Yacht Harbour.</li>
</ul>
CSSC have included Day Sails into their taster day programme and application for berths should be made to <a href="mailto:Jennifer.Yarrow@cssc.co.uk">Jennifer.Yarrow@cssc.co.uk</a> in the first instance.  A list of CSSC sponsored Day Sails and Sea Time Cruises in the South East Region can be found <a href="https://www.cssc.co.uk/CSSC/index.cfm/things-to-do/event-search/?imlookingfor=t_30&amp;regions=8">here</a>.

Group Day Sails are day sails that are arranged specifically for a group of people from the same organisation, department or just a group of friends. We will provide a qualified and experienced skipper and mate.
