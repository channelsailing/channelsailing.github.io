If you are booking on Training courses or Sea Time you will enjoy the experience all the more if you have suitable clothing.&nbsp; ie proper foul weather clothing and boots.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you turn up without any waterproofs then ask your skipper if you can borrow some old sowester style waterproofs are available for this purpose in the shed at Mercury Yacht Harbour.

To protect your hands, it is recommended that you purchase some fingerless sailing gloves.

The decks are white so the soles of all footwear must be non-marking.&nbsp; Sailing boots or deck shoes are recommended.

You will also need a hat to keep your head warm and protect you from the sun.&nbsp; Beanies are ideal as they do not blow off.&nbsp; Other hats will need some form of restraint.

Suncream / Lip balm

Sun glasses with some form of restraint

Stugeron 15 - Sea Sickness tablets work well for many people.&nbsp; Seek specific advice on this from your GP or pharmacist.
