<span style="font-family:Arial;"><a title="Mercury Yacht Harbour Website" href="http://www.mdlmarinas.co.uk/mdl-mercury-yacht-harbour">Mercury Yacht Harbour</a> is situated two miles from the mouth of the River Hamble where it is protected from the prevailing winds. Its tranquil rural setting makes this marina particularly popular with cruising families and those who enjoy a more gentle pace of boating. The marina has access to Southampton Water at all states of the tide. The sheltered waters of the Isle of Wight, with its bays, beaches, creeks, harbours and marinas, make this an ideal location for sailing of all kinds.

<h3>Directions</h3>
For those using SatNavs, the postcode for Mercury Yacht Harbour  is SO31 4HQ

<span style="font-family:Arial;">Otherwise, if coming by car, take the M27 motorway to junction 8, then follow signs to Hamble, going due SW up a short dual carriageway up a hill to a big roundabout, take the second exit A3025 past the Tesco superstore, over two mini roundabouts and one set of traffic lights, still going due South towards Hamble. After a plant nursery on the left take the first exit at the next roundabout, then immediately left into Satchell Lane about 50 yards past the roundabout.  Over a railway bridge and round several sharp bends, after about 1/2 mile look out for a left turn signposted Mercury Yacht Harbour, next to a holiday caravan site. Go down a short narrow rough road for about 200 yards and turn right through large wire gates into the large free car park. Close to the river on the corner of the main building is the harbourmaster's office, with luggage trolleys nearby.   Ask in the MDL Marinas office for the location of Sea Essay's berth.
