If you have sailed before you might want to be informed of sailing opportunities such as Sea Time Cruises and Charters where crew are required.    The CSD Crew Bureau serves this purpose.
<ul>
 	<li>Susie Welch is the point of contact for both <a href="//channelsailing.org/sea-time-cruises/">Sea Time Cruises</a> and the Crew Bureau and can be contacted via <a href="mailto:seatimebureau@channelsailing.org?subject=Enquiry%20from%20CSD%20Website:">seatimebureau@channelsailing.org</a></li>
 	<li>Remember that  your personal development and training plan is in your own hands.</li>
 	<li>If you can't manage to get all the sailing you need with CSD, then take a look at ECYD and 5KSC.</li>
</ul>
