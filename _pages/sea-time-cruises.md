Sea Time is a term used by CSD to refer generically to cruising events each year which are suitable for beginners, competent&nbsp; crew and aspiring skippers.

<ul>
 	<li>Sea Time Cruises are skippered by CSSA Approved Skippers who are nominated by the committee.</li>
 	<li>Sea Times are to provide members with opportunities to experience, learn and practice.  Within the bounds of safety and seamanship their wishes, hopefully elicited well before the event commences, should be accommodated by the Approved Skipper.</li>
 	<li>Most Sea Time cruises are coastal passages starting and finishing at <a href="//channelsailing.org/mercury-yacht-harbour/">Mercury Yacht Harbour</a> on the Hamble.</li>
 	<li>Sea Time Cruises in other sailing areas are often included in the programme for the Summer Cruise.</li>
</ul>
The number of berths available for each cruise is limited so<strong> if you are interested in taking part in Sea Time then please contact&nbsp;Susie Welch&nbsp;at the Crew Bureau&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="mailto:seatimebureau@channelsailing.org?subject=Enquiry from CSD Website:">seatimebureau@channelsailing.org </a></strong>
