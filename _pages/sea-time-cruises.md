'Sea Time' refers to cruising events which are suitable for beginners, competent&nbsp; crew and aspiring skippers.

<ul>
 	<li>Sea Time Cruises are skippered by CSSA Approved Skippers who are nominated by the committee.</li>
 	<li>Sea Time provides members with opportunities to experience, learn and practice sailing skills on a series of coastal passages to local harbours and anchorages.</li>
 	<li>Within the bounds of safety and seamanship the&nbsp; wishes of the crew, hopefully elicited well before the event commences, should be accommodated by the Approved Skipper.</li>
 	<li>Most Sea Time cruises start and finish at <a href="//channelsailing.org/mercury-yacht-harbour/">Mercury Yacht Harbour</a> on the Hamble.</li>
 	<li>Sea Time Cruises in other sailing areas are often included in the programme for the Summer Cruise.</li>
</ul>
The number of berths available for each cruise is limited.
