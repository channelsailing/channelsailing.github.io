Q. Where will I sleep?

A. Sea Essay has berths three cabins with double berths and there is an additional double berth in the Saloon.  The double berth in the bow has an en-suite 'heads' (toilet and wash-basin).

Q. Will I be sharing a berth?

A.  You may need to share a double berth. Whether you do or not will depend on a number of factors including the number of people on board.

Q.  Do I need a sleeping bag?

A. Yes.  While mattresses are provided, pillows and bedding is not.  You will therefore need to bring a sleeping bag.  A washable cotton sleeping bag liner is also recommended.  Bring a pillow too if you need one.
