(4) Issues and complaints.

CSD is run by a network of volunteers. Our terms and conditions set-out how we intend to operate and provide our members with a great experience. However, we recognise that on occasions things may not go as well as you or we would like.  If you experience issues with the CSD service, volunteers or other members please initially raise these directly with the relevant event organiser.  If subsequently you are not satisfied with how your issue is dealt with please contact one of the Club Officers.

We have processes to ensure any complaints are handled fairly.  Complaints need to be in writing (email is preferable) to the relevant organiser, or to the Club Captain, Club Secretary or Yacht Secretary. An investigation will take place and we may contact you or others for further information.  We will notify you and as appropriate, others of the outcome.
