<h3>Sea Time Cruises</h3>
Sea Time is a term used by CSD to refer generically to cruising events each year which are suitable for beginners, competent  crew and aspiring skippers.  Sea Time Cruises are skippered by CSSA Approved Skippers who are nominated by the committee.  The itinerary is typically determined by the skipper taking account of prevailing weather and the experience of the crew. Most Sea Time cruises are coastal passages starting and finishing at Mercury Yacht Harbour on the Hamble; however, Sea Time Cruises in other sailing areas are often included in the Summer Cruise.  These cruises are an ideal opportunity for members to put into practice skills learned on Competent Crew and Day Skipper Courses.  The number of berths is limited so<strong> if you are interested in taking part in Sea Time then please contact Susie Welch at the Crew Bureau on <a href="mailto:seatimebureau@channelsailing.org?subject=Enquiry from CSD Website:">seatimebureau@channelsailing.org </a></strong>
<a id="Day Sails"></a>
<h3>Day Sails and Group Day Sails</h3>
Day Sails are a fun day out from 09.00 hours to 18.00 hours as an introduction to sailing a yacht.  The day commences with a safety brief, then we motor down the Hamble River to Southampton Water, raise the sails and then into the sheltered waters of the Solent under sail. A stop for lunch and then return to the berth at Mercury Yacht Harbour.   CSSC have included Day Sails into their taster day programme and application for berths should be made to <a href="mailto:Jennifer.Yarrow@cssc.co.uk">Jennifer.Yarrow@cssc.co.uk</a> in the first instance.  A list of Day Sails and Sea Time Cruises in the CSSC South East Region can be found <a href="https://www.cssc.co.uk/CSSC/index.cfm/things-to-do/event-search/?imlookingfor=t_30&amp;regions=8">here</a>.
Alternatively we can organise a similar day out for a group, say from the same organisation, or just a group of friends. We will provide a qualified and experienced skipper and mate.  For more information and to apply for a Group Day Sail please contact Colin Smith <a href="mailto:csddaysails@gmail.com">csddaysails@gmail.com </a>
