Each year we organise a wide range of practical sailing courses.

We aim to have something for everyone from those who are new to sailing right through to yachtmasters who have aspirations to become an instructor.

So&nbsp;far as&nbsp;possible, courses are run on board the Club’s yacht <a href="https://channelsailing.wordpress.com/yacht/">Sea Essay of Hamble, a modern Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 409</a>

<h2><b>RYA Practical Courses</b></h2>
Channel Sailing Division is not an RYA&nbsp;Recognised Training Establishment so&nbsp;formal RYA&nbsp;courses will&nbsp;be delivered&nbsp;in association&nbsp;with commercial providers (details TBC):
<ul>
 	<li><b>Competent Crew</b> (no previous experience required) and <b>Day Skipper </b>- 5-day RYA syllabus with instruction by RYA qualified Skipper Instructors. &nbsp;If competent, students receive an RYA Course Completion Certificate.</li>

</ul>
<h2><b>Sea Time Cruises</b></h2>
Although not formal training courses, weekend and 7-day cruises can be used to gain RYA logbook entries such as sea time, mileage and night hours that satisfy course and examination requirements. If you are lucky enough to have an RYA instructor aboard, it may also be possible to get sections of the logbook signed-off for specific practical abilities.
<h2>Further&nbsp;information</h2>

 	<li>All on water training events start at 1800 hrs on the day before the start date for the event on the calendar.
