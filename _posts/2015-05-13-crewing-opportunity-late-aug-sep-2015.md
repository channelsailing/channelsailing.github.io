Here is an opportunity to sail ECYD's Freyja (Najad 380) from Rendsberg (on the Kiel Canal) to Delfziel (Netherlands).
Depending on weather, harbours to be visited include Cuxhaven, Helgoland, ports of the German Frisian Islands.
The cruise will start no earlier than Thursday 27 Aug and the yacht needs to be in Delziel by 6 Sep (Sunday).

It might be possible to start on the Saturday or join the yacht at Cuxhaven on Saturday 29 Aug.
The cost will be approx Â£50 per day (minimum of 8 days) plus share of food and marina charges - individuals will be required to make their own arrangements to travel to and from the yacht.

The relevant airports are Hamburg (for Rendsberg) and Schipol (for Delfziel), thence by train. The marinas are within 10 minutes walk of the nearest rail stations.

It would be helpful if you would circulate this crewing opportunity amongst your members.All
