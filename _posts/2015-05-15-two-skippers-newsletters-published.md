Two Skippers Newsletters have just been published on the <a href="https://channelsailing.wordpress.com/yacht/">Sea Essay Page</a>.  They are both quite long but as you will see there is a lot of important information and instructions to promulgate.  A number of these items will go into the operating manual.  You can also access these items from here.
