<span style="font-size:large;"><b>Mark Round</b></span><span style="font-size:large;"> has taken-over from Len Cresswell as CSSA Sea School Principal. Mark is reviewing the future structure of RYA recognised training within CSSA and preparing for the renewal of our RYA certificate in January. Additionally, he is acting as Chief Instructor for Channel Sailing Division.</span>

<span style="font-size:large;">Student interest in our Competent Crew / Day Skipper courses has been lower than in previous years, which has led to a reduction in courses. We are sorry to disappoint some but we did not reach the minimum number needed to make the courses work.</span>

<span style="font-size:large;">However, the </span><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Competent Crew / Day Skipper</b></span><span style="font-size:large;"> course split over Friday 9 to Sunday 11 October and Saturday 17 to Sunday 18 October is looking good with one training place still available.</span>

<span style="font-size:large;">Our October </span><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Sail Trim</b></span><span style="font-size:large;"> and </span><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Boat Handling</b></span><span style="font-size:large;"> Courses our currently full and all the places on the October </span><span style="font-size:large;"><b>YM Prep</b></span><span style="font-size:large;"> course have been allocated provisionally.</span>

<span style="font-size:large;">Training places are available on the one-day </span><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Radar</b></span><span style="font-size:large;"> courses scheduled for Monday 23 November and Tuesday 24 November.</span>

<span style="font-size:large;">Both the Sailing and the <a href="https://channelsailing.wordpress.com/sailing-programme/">Training programme</a> for this year has been updated and our </span><span style="font-size:large;"><b>2016 Training Programme</b></span><span style="font-size:large;"> will be developed over the next few months.</span>

<span style="font-size:large;">If you are interested in the remaining 2015 course places or being put on a standby list or simply want to discuss training, please contact me.</span>

<span style="font-size:large;">Fair winds and fine weather</span>
