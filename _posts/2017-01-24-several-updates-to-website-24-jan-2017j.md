Hi all,

There have been several updates to the website today.  Not least the <a href="//channelsailing.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/csd-sail-prog-2017-24jan17.pdf">24 Jan version of the  Sailing Programme</a> and the addition of a couple of Stop Press items to the Home Page highlighting the availability Sea Essay for charter for two legs of the Summer Cruise.

Please note that the planned Sail Trim for 26-28 April has moved to 11-13 Apr replacing Boat Handling 2.

I have also added a hyperlink to electronic copies of CS Sailing which can be found towards the bottom of the Home Page.
