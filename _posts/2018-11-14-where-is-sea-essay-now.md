Sea Essay is fitted with a AIS transponder that transmits her location other suitably equipped vessels.  This is a safety feature but as a side effect,  it enables anyone who who knows how to see where she goes.  If you are interested in following along then the<a href="//channelsailing.org/seaessay-2/where-is-sea-essay-now/"> following page</a>  (Click '<a href="//channelsailing.org/seaessay-2/where-is-sea-essay-now/">Continue Reading</a>') will explain how you can find out where she is and what you have been missing out on.

Note that AIS reception is better in some areas than others because  VHF signals rarely extend beyond  'line of sight'.
