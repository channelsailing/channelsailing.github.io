<p>Please complete the survey as soon as possible so that we can analyse the results and start constructing a viable cruise which in turn will allow us to complete next yearâ€™s sailing programme.  We intend that the 2020 Sailing Programme will be published leading up to the AGM in November and bookings for all our sailing opportunities will be accepted from the 23rd November.   </p>
